        <h4>MP3 player can offer better sound trace quality and more professional functionalities on soundtrack playing area.
            Compared to other soundtrack play devices, users desire a more efficient and convenient way to purchase it. Smart
            Vending Machine, named as MP3 box, can provide such services. MP3 box, as similar as another vending machine,
            offers all different types of MP3 player for the user to purchase by operating touchscreen on the machine.</h4>

        <h3 id="2">Requirements Summary</h3>
        <h4>
            <p>The primary purpose of the MP3 box is to provide an accessible way for users to purchase MP3. To archive this
                purpose, three major requirements are necessary, convenient location, safe environment, and comprehensive
                operation.
                <p/>
                <p>In part 1, we defined our task environment as public space with a large transient population such as malls,
                    or supermarkets. The characteristics of these space are high accessibility for customers who have purchasing
                    power. Therefore, the MP3 box can be served to more users in their daily life, and the first requirement,
                    convenient locations are satisfied.</p>
                <p>Second, since these locations are public places with high level of security, the various security measures,
                    such as cameras, guards, and sensors in the facilities can be exploited for our MP3 box. So, our second
                    demand, the safe environment is met. </p>
                <p>Lastly, these locations have the bright lights, large space for the machine. These characteristics are advantageous
                    to show many words on the screen. However, it can be vulnerable to leak personal information such as
                    credit card information to others. Also, one of the characteristics of our possible users in previous
                    assignment is professional, that users know or believe MP3 player is a better device to enjoy the music
                    than other devices. To more specific, these users already understand what MP3 player is, and several
                    possible features such as displaying lyric, equalizer, or FM transmitter. Although the users have domain
                    knowledge about an MP3 player than others, every customer has a different degree of knowledge about each
                    model, for example, full functionalities of every single model, and how good their sound quality is.
                    Of course, some customers have sufficient experience and knowledge of the specific model. </p>
                <p>Therefore, to meet our third requirement, comprehensive operation, and to complete part 2, we can summarize
                    our environment and requirements as below,</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Location Characteristics</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Public and high transient population</li>
                        <li>Bright and roomy space to set machine</li>
                        <li>Noisy environment</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>User Characteristics - Common </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Believe that MP3 player is superior music player than other devices</li>
                        <li>Having general knowledge on the MP3 player, with possible functionalities</li>
                        <li>Interested in sound quality of each device, and detail information</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li> Different degree of knowledge and experience of a specific model</li>
                        <li> Different purpose to operate the MP3 box, for example, to buy, rent, return or get information. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Task Requirements</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide friendly interface for users so that every customer can easily interact with MP3 box</li>
                        <li>Figure out customer’s demand, for example, does he/she already bear a specific model in mind? Want
                            to examine several models? Alternatively, want to get a recommendation?</li>
                        <li>Show customized information for each customer with sound testing for each device.</li>
                        <li>Keep security in open place during customer pay for the products.</li>

        <h4>
            <p>
                <strong>What requirements may be difficult to realize?</strong>
            </p>
            Providing customized information for each customer might be challenging to realize. For example, if a customer asks to the
            machine to recommend which product will be the best fit for him, machine have to find correct answers based on
            the insufficient information about the customer. It will require more complex technologies such as data mining,
            and machine learning. If we made a simple algorithm for recommendation system with several IF-Else statement,
            it is not likely the one which the customer wants.</h4>
        <h4>
            <p>
                <strong>What are some tradeoffs that you should or did explore?</strong>
            </p>
            We assumed that our possible customer has some degree of knowledge of MP3 player in general, then we design the friendly
            and simple interface based on this assumption. So we do not need to consider about explaining basic information
            of the device, such as what is MP3 or what is the advantage of using MP3 player. However, it is not clear that
            if we need to explain about detail specification, or functionalities, for example, what is the FLAC format, or
            what is FM transmitting function. Because some people do not know that information at all, even he has general
            knowledge of the MP3 player. So there is a trade-off between skipping information to reduce inconvenience for
            expert user and showing information for the relatively intermediate user to satisfy their desire to know. </h4>

        <h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Which tasks will be easiest to support? Which is hardest?</strong>
            </p>
            To figure out what is the purpose of customer who is using the MP3 box, will be the easiest to support. The machine just
            needs to receive customer request by touch screen button or voice, examine the database if it is required, then
            show the result on the screen. For example, if the customer requests the machine about the information of A product,
            the machine searched the database if A product exists, then show a description and asks if he wants to purchase
            this one. However, Implementing a sound testing function for every product. To make it correctly, we need to
            plug into each device with earphone and switch to another device to test it. Given those devices should be unboxed
            and the new one, it is hard to apply this method. Alternatively, we may make some sample devices to be opened
            to customers for testing. However, there will be space and price limitation to make sample devices for all products.
            And, we can record the every device playing sound and store inside the vending machine’s memory, then play with
            machine’s speaker. However, it is hard to guarantee that playing recorded sound is equal to sound quality of
            each device.

        <h3 id="4">Design Summary</h3>
        <h4>We considered three designs for this implementation, and two of them will be discarded, and the other one will be
            pursued for the next step. The discarded ideas focused on basic request and responded interfaces for purchasing
            MP3 players. If the product is a snack or soft drinks, this method can be accepted. However, given that MP3 player
            is relatively complicated and various product fields, the customer will not want to purchase it from traditional
            simple vending machines. In other hands, our selected design tries to combine these simple interface and recommendation
            system based on the customer’s preferences. This recommendation system, customers can feel like that they are
            talking with a real salesperson in the store because the major responsibility of salesperson is to suggest customized
            information to the customer. This advantage can be resulted in that satisfying our task requirements such as
            providing a friendly interface, finding customer’s demand and responding with proper information. </h4>

            This design focus on providing the functionality towards the soundtrack quality of MP3 player. Each kind of product will
            have one sample showcase for sound testing. The user can test the sound quality of the selected MP3 player by
            just clicking the button. If the quality is acceptable to the user, the user can go to next step to continue
            shopping. Otherwise, the user will continue to try other products.

            Mark, 15 years old boy already has his metallic MP3 player. One day he heard from his friend, that there is a new MP3 player
            whose body material is glass. However, the friend could not remember the model. Mark got curious, rushed to the
            MP3 box in a nearby shopping mall, touched the advanced search to find the device which has glass material. Mark
            select body part on device image then select glass in the detail menu. Then he can see the list of MP3 players
            whose bodies are made of glass.

                <strong>The degree to which our requirements can be met by the design</strong>
            </p>
            We assumed that our user would be the one either already bare a specific model in mind, or want to examine several models.
            This design can determine these user’s demand by asking quick search or advanced search. In advanced model, there
            are many graphical icons, so that they will increase the efficiency of finding. Therefore, the user can find
            a model quickly. The security problem does not matter in this case if we make covered number pad. However, there
            is a possibility that other person can recognize what the user is doing since graphical resources are readily
            shown in the distance. Although this design support sound testing functions, there is a limitation to provide
            customized information.

            This design focuses on making a friendly interface which feels like to talk with a salesperson. Based on the user’s selection,
            the machine will respond similarly to live communication in the store. This design assumes that consumer can
            be categorized into three types; just looking for a specific model, examining everything, asking recommendation
            based on his/her preferences.

            not confident about what kinds of player her nephew likes. She heard that Tom prefers to listen to music with
            his big Bluetooth wireless headset. So, Mary thought that it would be safe if she purchases a device which supports
            Bluetooth connection. Mary went to the MP3 box, and fortunately, the device has an option that recommends the
            products based on her demands. She asks(in fact, touch the button) to the artificial salesperson that she only
            consider Bluetooth is supporting. MP3 box shows the list of MP3 players which satisfy that condition. Finally,
            Mary can purchase the proper present for her nephew.

            product’s list based on user’s preferences, so that it can provide a customized information for each customer.
            Like other design, it will have a sound testing function, and covered keypad to prevent leaking user’s private
            information. So this design can archive effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of our task requirements.

            it can figure out what is user’s needs, this design can provide proper information to the customer. Also, by
            suggesting the list of products that customer likely prefer, it makes possible to give customized information.
            Moreover, the idea of sound testing functionality give more useful information for decision making, and covered

        <h4>We reconsidered the Part 1, to make a concrete analysis of the characteristics of location and user, then set up
            task requirements. Although we thought about making the sound testing function in the interface, it will be hard
            to implement in practice. So we need to delete that requirement. However, we found that suggesting proper recommendation
            based on the customer’s preferences will be the critical point that this machine can replace existing selling
            system by the salesperson. We tried to suggest the initial idea of that recommendation system during this design
            process. However, for more improvement, we need to consider about how to get essential information of the customer,
            and suggest a correct information that customer wants to. </h4>

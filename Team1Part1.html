        <h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Task Characteristics</strong>
            </p>
            <p>MP3 box is a smart vending machine that has several features compared to other channels to get a MP3 player,
                including affordances, visibility, and conceptual model for user. User can easily access the system by operating
                touch screen to make a successful purchase as the following flow. If they don’t feel satisfying their purchased
                product, MP3 box offers very simple way to return their product with few steps. Also, support service is
                always for the clients who need technical problems, such as out of order machine.</p>

            <p>
                <strong>Task environment</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Considering the evaluability of the product in which MP3 box selling, the MP3 box will be mainly located at the
                mall or supermarket area so that not only people can easily access the MP3 box but also the product can remain
                secured all the time.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Structured task analysis of the problem</strong>
            </p>
            <p>The following is a hierarchical task analysis of operating MP3 box successfully.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <img src="resources/img/p1-1.png" class="img-responsive">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>For customer choosing MP3 player instead of other devices because they believe that MP3 would provide the best
                soundtrack quality than others. Thus, it’s extremely important to check the soundtrack quality while they
                purchase or rent a MP3 player in the vending machine. However, the system doesn’t provide product trial during
                the whole purchasing process. It will cause unnecessary and inconvenient problems to users. For example,
                after making a successful payment, user get the wanted MP3 from box. But after he played the music in the
                MP3 player, he found that the quality of sound track performed by this payer doesn’t satisfy him, which he
                need to return it back to the box. However, for protecting our product from the abusive users, it would take
                one or two business days to handle such thing. This consequence will be seriously damage commercial business.
                So, it’s important to address such issue for the users and MP3 box business.</p>

        <h3 id="4">Strong Points and Deficiencies of the MP3 Box which is Assumed Existing</h3>
        <h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Strong Points</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Time Saving
                    <br/> As the value of time is more increasing than before for modern people, fast processing for any kinds
                    of work is mandatory to stay competitive. Usually, purchasing a high-end electric device is time-consuming
                    work, since we need to visit the store and consult with sales clerks to buy these things include the
                    MP3 player. To be specific, we need to wait until one of the sales clerks come to us after finishing
                    his previous sales, listen to many descriptions of several products, negotiation about the price, promotion,
                    or service plan and so on. Although preliminary knowledge may vary on a person-to-person basis, all the
                    customer should go through all the process until purchase decision. However, if we already decided for
                    the specific target device, we do not need to endure this boring process. Thanks to the MP3 Box, the
                    consumer can save their time without time-consuming. They just look for what they need, select, pay,
                    then take it within a short time. Therefore, time-saving is one of the biggest reason for the necessary
                    of the MP3 Box.
                </li>
                <li>Accessibility
                    <br/> To open a business store, the owner should consider its location. Since there are fixed costs such as
                    rent, personnel expenses, or incidental expenses, the location of the store should be chosen to maximize
                    their profit. Consequentially, the number of stores are limited, resulted in limited accessibility for
                    the customers. However, when we consider using a vending machine, we just need small space to put it
                    with less expensive managing costs. Also, owners can set several machines at several locations with the
                    same budget to manage one store. That means the customer has more accessibility to get the service. With
                    same reasons, if MP3 Box placed at many places, potential customers have more opportunity to meet this
                    machine, and they can purchase MP3 player without efforts to search a store and move to there. Also,
                    owners can make more profit from various sales locations. So, accessibility is the second strong point
                    of MP3 Box.
                </li>
                <li>Comfortability
                    <br/> Some, maybe most of the customers feels uncomfortable when sales clerks try to start a conversation,
                    even it is just for greetings. Usually, as the conversation is getting longer and longer, the burden
                    of purchasing of the customer is also increased because of rewarding psychology. That can be resulted
                    in buying unnecessary products. In this case, the customer gets a bad feeling from this experience, and
                    he will have a negative stereotype of sales clerk although when sales person introduces bet fit product
                    to the customer. This is not optimistic for stimulating the market and customer’s healthy shopping regarding
                    economic. However, if there are many vending machines such as an MP3 box, customers do not need to worry
                    about the burden of purchasing something. The machine just introduces, and show what customer wants,
                    and only respond to customer’s request. There is no feeling of guilt when the client does not’ purchase
                    anything after using the machine long time. In this reason, comfortability is the last benefit of using
                    MP3 Box.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Deficiencies</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lack of Information
                    <br/> Despite several advantages of MP3 Box, there are several shortcomings. First, the customer cannot get
                    enough information about each product. Our assumed existing MP3 box has an idea of providing a simple
                    description of MP3 player, but it is not sufficient to introduce full features of the product because
                    most of the high-end electric device has a complex and long list of specifications and functionalities.
                    Although we can show every detail of all the goods on the kiosk screen, it is not practical to read everything
                    in front of the vending machine. Also, regarding time-saving, just displaying every information is harmful
                    to get this advantage. MP3 player is relatively expensive product than any other products sold at vending
                    machines. Not enough information cannot be attractive to the possible customer. Therefore, we need to
                    find a way how to provide sufficient information with efficient way.
                </li>
                <li>Wrong Purchase Decision
                    <br/> Modern MP3 players have various features such as showing lyrics, playing video clips, synchronizing
                    with other devices, supporting radio transmitter, wireless connecting, fetching digital multimedia from
                    the store, and so on. Moreover, each feature can be broken down into more detail. For example, if we
                    consider about the screen of MP3 player, there are sub-categories such as size, touch-sensing, color,
                    ratio, and gesture recognition. Therefore, the customer should make sure what kinds of the specification
                    they need for best purchase decision, and this is possible when we consult with a trained professional
                    sales person who can match our demand and specific product. However, existing MP3 box cannot figure out
                    our desire; then customer easily failed to purchase the good product. So, finding the best product for
                    each customer during interaction is the one thing we need to overcome.
                </li>
                <li>Limitation of Hearing Test
                    <br/> We defined our customer as a professional person who believes an MP3 player is a better one to listen
                    to music. So, quality of sound which supported by the device is a sensitive factor in determining to
                    purchase. For example, we can easily see that many in-store music player markets are providing several
                    headset or speaker to experience and test the sound quality of each device. That is the most significant
                    difference between purchasing an MP3 player from vending machine and store. Therefore, we need to find
                    innovational interface or alternative idea to let the customer test and listen each device’s sound.
                </li>
                <li>Limited Payment Method
                    <br/> We assumed that existing MP3 box could accept credit/debit card, and cash for payment methods. Given
                    the high price of the MP3 player, those three methods are not enough to fulfill all the customer’s demand.
                    The sales person in the expensive electric market suggests alternative payment methods to promote their
                    sales and make feel better to purchase the product. For example, they can suggest an installment of payment
                    plan through long-term, discount by registering promotional events, moreover, some store support cryptographic
                    currency such as Bitcoin for more convenience payment. Therefore, we need to research if there are other
                    alternative payment methods than a traditional vending machine.

        <h3 id="5">The Larger Social and Technical System in which Our Design will Intersect</h3>
        <h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Social System</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Individualistic Culture
                    <br/> Although it is a not optimistic tendency, modern people do not want to be involved in person to person
                    interaction in every situation in our life. In the past day, people had lived in small boundary for their
                    life, so the social connection is critical since that is the only way they get the information. In contrast,
                    we have too exposed to many human relationships thanks to an excellent transfer and communication innovation.
                    Now People want to be individual unless it is not an essential part of our life. Purchasing product can
                    be one of the situations which does not need to make a new human relationship. Using vending machine
                    can give us an opportunity to be an alone from tired human connections.
                </li>
                <li>Manpower Replacement
                    <br/> As technology improved day by day, human labor can be replaced by a machine such as assembly robots
                    in a car factory. Although it can make social problem such as decreasing hiring rate, we can concentrate
                    on more valuable activity rather than simple and repeated labor. Also, it can give us more time to enjoy
                    the recreational activity as a human. The vending machine can also contribute to this tendency to replace
                    sales clerk with a machine which has more accurate and professional functionality.
                </li>
                <li>Intellectual Satisfaction
                    <br/> Since we can find many of information from the Internet, in some areas, we do not need a professional
                    assistant in some field. Also, as we can see the success of IKEA which sells DIY furniture with low price,
                    giving the opportunity to achieve difficult process by ourselves makes much enjoyment. Figuring out our
                    best MP3 player from MP3 box based on our knowledge and acquired information will be a good chance to
                    feel intellectual satisfaction. Of course, it is impossible and not so beneficial to understand every
                    detail of all the products. So, if we can design a proper interface to provide best-fit information make
                    the customer decide best products or understand specific knowledge of the device, the MP3 box can be
                    successful.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Technical System</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Integrated Information
                    <br/> MP3 player is a small device but connected in various industry such as entertainment, display, sound
                    player, product material, storage, battery, and so on. In respect to the customer, each person has a
                    different background such as a preference for the music genre, color, size, or extra functions. So, the
                    MP3 box should integrate all these information from the various source, and suggest possible options
                    which can be acceptable to each customer. Therefore, the ability to combine data for products and customer
                    to produce valuable information is the essential technology of MP3 box designing.
                </li>
                <li>Big Data
                    <br/> Relate to the previous integrated information; big data is the important technology of designing MP3
                    box. To suggest best options to customer, the MP3 box should rely on the previous purchasing history
                    of other customers which has a similar preference with the current customer. Also, the machine also need
                    plenty of information of MP3 players to make sufficient database. Therefore, big data technology is required
                    to design good MP3 box.
                </li>
                <li>Enhanced Interface
                    <br/> The traditional interface of vending machines is relying on mechanical or touch screen buttons. That
                    makes limited purchasing experience since the customer only has one-way interaction with vending machines.
                    In case of our MP3 box, to figure out customer’s demand, and suggest best information are an essential
                    part of our design, the machine should support more complex touch behavior such as gesture action on
                    the screen for zooming up and out.

            <p>
                <strong>List of Criteria or Principles</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learnability
                    <br/>Many customers to our MP3 box will face challenging to understand how to use this machine since this
                    kind of vending machine has not existed so far, and there will be several steps to purchase a product
                    compare to the traditional simple vend-ing machine. Therefore, measuring how much new customer can start
                    effective in-teraction with the machine and get a proper result is a critical factor to evaluate learnability
                    of our MP3 box. For example,
                    <ul>
                        <li>Does customer understand all the interface component’s purpose and its re-sult? </li>
                        <li>Does customer understand how to input his request? </li>
                        <li>Does machine explain difficult terminology to make the customer under-stand?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Flexibility
                    <br/> In case of in-store purchasing, we can always ask any question or do any behavior to sales clerk even
                    he is talking about specific topics. Because we cannot make our decision in the strict process, the MP3
                    box should allow flexibility to the customer like a human sales person. For example,
                    <ul>
                        <li>Does customer ask query to the machine during any purchase stages? </li>
                        <li>Can customer skip any steps if he thinks that is not necessary for him? </li>
                        <li>Does customer have various options to input his intention?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Robustness
                    <br/>The MP3 box should support features, make the customer feel the whole process and result are resulted
                    by his intention and confirm the goal is achieved.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Can customer back to previous steps to modify his request? </li>
                        <li>Does machine show the proper response whenever there is customer’s input?</li>
                        <li>Does machine have a proper method to output the result corresponding to cus-tomer’s request? </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

                <strong>How to measure</strong>
            </p>
            <p>To evaluate our design, we will use query technique such as interview and ques-tionnaires. These two techniques
                are complementary each other. Although both are performed based on pre-fixed questions, interviewing can
                provide unpredicted in-formation, and deep insight of the problem, on the other hand, questionnaires can
                provide quick and quantitative measurement value to us. Therefore, once we com-plete the design of MP3 box
                in forms of storyboard or mock-up application, we can provide it to various people who have different age,
                gender, then conduct an interview and a survey.

        <h3 id="7">Discussion of the Implications of What We Learned</h3>
        <h4> After we discussed our new design of the MP3 vending machine, we figure out that the most important thing is to maximize
            customer’s satisfaction during purchasing or learning about the products. Moreover, it is only possible based
            on the detailed research on defining the characteristic of users, required task, social and technical environment,
            analyzing on the current assumed existing system.
            <br/> Based on the research, we found that we need to consider how to convey essential information to get customer’s
            request and suggest best-fitted options to personal preference in short time without verbose. The information
            to understand each person’s liking is not only written text but also visual and auditory materials. Especially,
            we take note of the way how to make a heuristic interface that customer can get the direct experience of the
            devices. One of the ideas for this heuristic interface is providing a method for testing the quality of the sound
            of each MP3 players. We expect that this features can be extended more heuristic interface for any other device’s
            features.

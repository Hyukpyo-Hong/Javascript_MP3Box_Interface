        <h4>We selected the third model from the step 2. This design focuses on making a friendly interface which feels like
            to talk with a salesperson. Based on the user’s selection, the machine will respond similarly to live communication
            in the store. We assumed that the possible clients have three types, the first type has a specific model in mind
            before he comes to the machine, the second type wants to see the whole list, and the last type wants to get a
            recommendation based on his demand. Our prototype is developed to satisfy these three types of customer.

        <h3 id="7">Rationale</h3>
        <h4>
            One of our concern about the possible customers is that although they already have some degree of knowledge of the MP3 player,
            they might have a different level of knowledge, and difference preference for the buying experience. Given these
            assumptions, our prototype suggests three different methods to find products. Out three methods to find a product;
            direct search, whole list search, recommendation search will satisfy all types of customers.
            <br/> Also, with using Salesperson character and conversation style interface, we tried to make customers friendly
            feeling. Some people may feel uncomfortable when they purchase expensive or complicated electronic device from
            the non-human vending machine. So, this artificial salesperson can reduce those sense of difference.
            <br/> Finally, one of the advantages of consulting with a salesperson is getting information about the products, and
            recommendation which can fit our preference. So we implemented recommendation interface which can explain technical
            jargon of MP3 player, and make a suggestion based on users priorities.
            <br/> However, several problems can occur in Recommendation system. Because categorizing all the people’s preference
            and making an algorithm which can provide suggesting list based on only several keywords that user checked. So
            it will take some time to make robust system which has sufficient database and proper algorithm.
            <br/> Based on these reasons, we made our prototype to meet our requirement, and evaluate how much our interface can
            satisfy our possible customers.

        <h3 id="8">Changed Requirements</h3>
        <h4>After several discussion for our prototype, we found that voice recognition in the third model of Part2 is hard to
            make in our prototype, although its advantages are not so much. In fact, our assumption of the location where
            the MP3 box is, open and public space that there are many people and some degree of noisy. So, voice recognition
            function is not proper for the location and it was removed from our prototype. And we added a new function which
            can explain terms of an MP3 player. For example, some people can don’t know what is the ‘Lyric supporting’ or
            ‘various EQ setting’ although they are already familiar with the MP3 player. Therefore, we added this explanation
            function on the recommendation interface, to show its detail whenever the user clicks their priority. </h4>

        <h3 id="9">Initial Evaluation Plan</h3>
        <h4>
            Our usability criteria will focus on evaluating how much our project requirements which derived from the work of part1 through
            part3, can be satisfied. Therefore, the list of main criteria are as below,
            <br/>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Location Suitability: Is our prototype is suitable for open and public space where many people are around the device, and
                    some degree of noise is there.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Satisfy common user characteristics: Is our prototype support only necessary information, or interaction with our possible
                    customers? Is there any unnecessary and wordy explanation which can interfere the user experience?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Satisfy different user characteristics: Is our prototype suggest various methods which can satisfy different user preference?
                    Is it support sufficient information when user request? Is it easy to find proper buttons or components
                    on the screen when the user needs?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Convenience Interface: Is our prototype support user-friendly interface which makes user feels in a real store with a real
                    salesperson? Can user test the device’s performance? Is it safe when user make payment?
                </li>
            </ul>
            To evaluate our prototype, we will consider three techniques which can give us sufficient feedback so that we can understand
            how much our requirements are satisfied, and what is possible problems in the prototype
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Think aloud and cooperative evaluation
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            We will provide our prototype to make user test by himself, and ask them to speak aloud whatever they think. During the session,
                            we will ask them an additional question such as ‘Why’ or ‘What if’ style to make them test all
                            of the functionalities in the interface.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    Interview
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            After we test our prototype with ’ Think aloud and cooperative evaluation’ method, we will perform interview to gathering
                            more high-level information such as user preferences, impressions, and attitudes. Also, to do
                            an effective interview, we will also use following questions to get more structured information
                            during the interview.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>
                            As we mentioned above, during the interview, we will provide following question based on the Nielsen’s ten heuristics. More
                            specific questions are as below,
